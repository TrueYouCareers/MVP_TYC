What We Are Suggesting (With Examples)
For a 10th Class Student (Stream Suggestion + Natural Interests)
Problem:
A student is confused between Science, Commerce, and Humanities. Parents push for Science; the child enjoys public speaking and storytelling.
How We Help:
* Ask them a few simple, interest-based questions like:
"Do you enjoy solving puzzles?",
"Do you find yourself explaining things to friends?",
"Do you like experimenting, researching, or speaking?"
* Use these to map natural inclination.
* Suggest streams like:
o Humanities with a Public Speaking & Governance Path (if interest is politics or law)
o Commerce with an Entrepreneurial Tilt (if interest is business)
o Or Science, only if matched with deep curiosity and aptitude
* Output:
A clear, psychologically aligned stream suggestion + possible future paths.

For a 12th Class Student (Career Path Clarity)
Problem:
A student from Commerce with Maths doesn't know whether to go for B.Com, BBA, or prepare for CA. They're unsure about future jobs.
How We Help:
* Ask them questions like:
"Do you like working with numbers or leading a group?"
"Would you prefer a government job or a private one?"
"Are you open to learning tools like Excel, Digital Marketing, etc.?"
* Based on responses, we suggest:
