Career Path for B.A. Graduates: UI/UX Design or Creative Design Roles (with a focus on UX Research)

Why it fits for B.A. Graduates:
B.A. graduates, especially those with an inclination towards visual thinking, creativity, psychology, or anthropology, can excel in UI/UX (User Interface/User Experience) design and research. Their understanding of human behavior, empathy, and critical thinking skills are valuable assets in designing user-centered products and experiences. The research aspect of UX particularly aligns well with skills developed in many Arts and Humanities disciplines.

What you'll work on in UI/UX Design or UX Research:
* User Research: Conducting user interviews, surveys, usability testing, and analyzing user behavior to understand needs, pain points, and motivations. (Strong fit for B.A. skills)
* User Persona & Journey Mapping: Creating representations of target users and mapping out their interactions with a product or service.
* Wireframing & Prototyping: Creating low-fidelity and high-fidelity mockups and interactive prototypes of app/web interfaces.
* UI Design: Designing the visual layout, look, and feel of digital interfaces, focusing on aesthetics and usability.
* Visual Storytelling and Layouts: Applying design principles to create intuitive and engaging user interfaces.
* Collaboration: Working closely with product managers, developers, and other stakeholders.

Skills to Add/Develop:
* Design Tools:
    * Start with Canva for basic graphic design.
    * Progress to industry-standard tools like Figma, Adobe XD, or Sketch for UI/UX design and prototyping.
* UX Principles: Understanding of user-centered design, usability principles, user journeys, wireframes, information architecture.
* Design Psychology & Empathy: Ability to understand and advocate for the user.
* Research & Analytical Skills: For UX research, skills in qualitative data analysis, survey design, and interview techniques.
* Communication & Presentation Skills: To present design concepts and research findings.
