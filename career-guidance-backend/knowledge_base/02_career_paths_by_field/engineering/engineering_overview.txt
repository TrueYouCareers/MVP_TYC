// Engineering Career Paths in India: Overview
//
// Engineering is a vast field offering diverse career opportunities. It involves applying scientific and mathematical principles to design, develop, and maintain structures, machines, devices, systems, materials, and processes.
//
// Common Branches:
// 1. Computer Science & IT: Software development, data science, AI/ML, cybersecurity, etc.
// 2. Mechanical Engineering: Design, manufacturing, thermal sciences, robotics, automotive, etc.
// 3. Electrical Engineering: Power systems, electronics, control systems, telecommunications, etc.
// 4. Electronics & Communication Engineering: Embedded systems, VLSI, telecommunications, IoT, etc.
// 5. Civil Engineering: Structural design, construction, transportation, environmental engineering, etc.
// 6. Chemical Engineering: Process design, plant operations, petrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, etc.
// 7. Aerospace Engineering: Aircraft and spacecraft design, aerodynamics, propulsion, etc.
// 8. Biomedical Engineering: Medical device development, biomechanics, clinical engineering, etc.
//
// Entry Route:
// - Typically a Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) or Bachelor of Engineering (B.E.) degree in a specific engineering discipline.
// - Admission is usually through competitive entrance examinations like JEE Main, JEE Advanced, BITSAT, and state-level exams.
//
// General Skills Required:
// - Strong analytical and problem-solving skills.
// - Proficiency in mathematics and science.
// - Creativity and innovation.
// - Attention to detail.
// - Teamwork and communication skills.
// - Adaptability and willingness to learn new technologies.
//
// Career Progression:
// Entry-level engineer -> Senior Engineer -> Technical Lead -> Project Manager -> Engineering Manager -> Higher management roles (e.g., CTO, Head of Engineering).
// Options also include research (M.Tech, PhD), entrepreneurship, or shifting to techno-managerial roles.
