// Top Engineering Colleges in India
//
// India has a vast network of engineering colleges, both government-funded and private, known for their quality education and research.
//
// 1. Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs):
//    - Premier institutions for engineering education and research.
//    - Examples: IIT Bombay, IIT Delhi, IIT Madras, IIT Kanpur, IIT Kharagpur, IIT Roorkee, IIT Guwahati, etc.
//    - Programs: B.Tech, M.Tech, Dual Degree, Ph.D. in various engineering disciplines.
//    - Admission: Through JEE Advanced (candidates must qualify JEE Main first).
//
// 2. National Institutes of Technology (NITs):
//    - Institutes of national importance offering high-quality engineering education.
//    - Examples: NIT Trichy, NIT Warangal, NIT Surathkal, NIT Calicut, MNNIT Allahabad, NIT Rourkela.
//    - Programs: B.Tech, M.Tech, Ph.D.
//    - Admission: Through JEE Main.
//
// 3. Birla Institute of Technology and Science (BITS):
//    - A leading private deemed university with campuses in Pilani, Goa, Hyderabad, and Dubai.
//    - Known for its flexible curriculum and industry collaborations.
//    - Programs: B.E., M.E., Ph.D.
//    - Admission: Through BITSAT (BITS Admission Test).
//
// 4. Indian Institutes of Information Technology (IIITs):
//    - Focus on Information Technology and allied areas.
//    - Two types: Centrally funded (e.g., IIIT Allahabad, IIIT Gwalior) and Public-Private Partnership (PPP) mode (e.g., IIIT Hyderabad, IIIT Bangalore - though these two have unique statuses and are highly ranked).
//    - Programs: B.Tech, M.Tech, Ph.D. primarily in CS, IT, ECE.
//    - Admission: Mostly through JEE Main. Some IIITs (like Hyderabad) have their own entrance exams or use other criteria.
//
// 5. Other Prominent Government Engineering Colleges:
//    - Jadavpur University, Kolkata (Faculty of Engineering & Technology)
//    - Delhi Technological University (DTU), Delhi
//    - Netaji Subhas University of Technology (NSUT), Delhi
//    - College of Engineering, Pune (COEP)
//    - Anna University, Chennai (College of Engineering, Guindy)
//    - Admission: Typically through state-level entrance exams or JEE Main scores.
//
// 6. Top Private Engineering Colleges (Examples):
//    - Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT), Vellore
//    - Manipal Institute of Technology (MIT), Manipal
//    - PSG College of Technology, Coimbatore
//    - Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology, Patiala
//    - RV College of Engineering, Bangalore
//    - Admission: Usually through their own entrance examinations (e.g., VITEEE, MET) or JEE Main scores.
//
// When choosing a college, consider factors like NIRF ranking, faculty, infrastructure, research output, placements, and alumni network.
