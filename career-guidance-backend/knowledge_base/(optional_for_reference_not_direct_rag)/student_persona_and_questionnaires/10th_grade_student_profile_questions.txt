*   "Do you like experimenting, researching, or speaking?" (Covers Science, Research, Communication)

How these questions are used:
The pattern of answers helps map the student's natural tendencies. For example:
*   Consistent 'A' choices might suggest a strong inclination towards the Science stream.
*   'B' and 'D' choices might point towards Humanities or Arts.
*   'C' choices could indicate an aptitude for Commerce.
The analysis aims to provide a reasoned suggestion for a stream that aligns with their interests, along with potential future career paths related to that stream.
